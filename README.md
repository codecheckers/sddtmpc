# Implementation of SDD-TMPC (state-dependent dynamic tube model predictive control) for a nonlinear problem

## Project description 

The code in this repository is used to implement and test a new algorithm called SDD-TMPC for a nonlinear system. It is a control algorithm that sacrifices some optimality (much less than tube MPC), but provides robust solutions (more about this can be found in [2]). In this repository, NTMPC (from [1]) and SDD-TMPC have been implemented to control a unicycle robot. To run the code, you have to execute the main file. All parameters (robot's maximum speed, MPC's horizon, etc.) can be found in the main file. The "figures" folder contains all the figures. The final data is stored in "final_data.mat".


## How to use

To use the code, you need Matlab (the code has been tested for 2022a) and the listed dependencies. To run the simulation, you need to run the main.m. Using parameters, it is possible to investigate the behavior of the controller for other problems. All necessary information can be found in the comments. 

## Dependencies

Matlab's optimization toolbox (to use interior-point algorithm) - https://nl.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html

Matlab's global optimization toolbox (to use particle swarm) - https://nl.mathworks.com/products/global-optimization.html


## Known problems

The software needs a lot of time to run the simulation because SDDTMPC needs more than 20 seconds to solve the optimization problem which was solved with particle swarm algorithm. It is a global optimization algorithm and the problem is nonlinear, so we cannot guarantee that the global minimum will be found. Because of this, the final trajectories depend on the random generator. We use the solution of NTMPC as a starting set of decision variables, but it is not a perfect solution and multi-start would be too time-consuming.
